This repository contains the components needed to run experiments to estimate performance of different distributed lock configurations.

# Experimental run

## Micro experiment
Start system \\
set configuration \\
run experiment \\
stop system

## Mini experiment
For each workload, do micro experiment

## Experiment
For each lock configuration, do mini experiment

## Entire run
For each application, do experiment
